"""Lifecycle — the task/agent state-machine substrate (the Lifecycle PILLAR).

Peer to ``intent.py`` and ``memory.py``: the engine holds one ``Lifecycle``
(``engine.lifecycle``) and capabilities reach it via ``ctx.lifecycle`` (Spec 339).
It is NOT a capability — it is the pillar substrate. Verb frame:
**open · move · close** (write) + **status** (read). States align with A2A tasks.
An *agent* is a Lifecycle parameterization (a who-session), linked DISPATCHED_TO.

Spec 339 hardening: ``open`` mints ``submitted`` (was ``working``); ``move`` is a
general **state-shaped** transition and the **sole writer** of ``Lifecycle.state``
(it validates the target against the closed enum and refuses a no-op); ``close``
drives to a terminal state through ``move``. The full A2A transition table (340),
transition events (344), and parameterization (342) build on this frame.

Lifecycle state mutates in place (so SERVES/DISPATCHED_TO edges stay stable);
append-only bi-temporality is demonstrated on Intent (see intent.py).
