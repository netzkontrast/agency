# Spec 349 — The pillar event-registration bus (subscribe · emit · configure)

> Owner directive: *"extend the lifecycle events to have all events (also hooks)
> configurable (config.yaml) for external hooks, and a way for capabilities,
> intent and Memory to register themselves for events — so a capability can emit
> a snippet when, for instance, the develop capability receives a pre-tool hook
> and sees this is the first time this tool is used; then it emits relevant
> information to the agent, but only once. And then many more events each
> capability — or each pillar — can emit."* This spec designs that bus.

> **Scope (owner Q4 = "full architecture, no build"):** this is a complete

## Why

Agency already has the *primitive* and three disconnected *event sources*; what it
lacks is the *bus* that lets any pillar declare interest and react.

**The open primitive (verified, `agency-infra.md` §2):** hook handlers live in a
per-engine dict `engine._hook_handlers` (engine.py:704-708) with a public
`register_hook_handler(event_name, fn)` (engine.py:764-768); `dispatch_hook`
routes exact-match-else-`*`-catch-all (engine.py:770-779). It is an **open set**,
not an if/elif. **But the dict is seeded once in `Engine.__init__` and no loop
reads capability-declared subscriptions.** Capabilities self-register *verbs* (by
reflection) — they cannot self-register *event interest*. That missing loop is the
heart of this spec.

**The three event sources today, unconnected:**

- **Hook events** (Spec 076) — `dispatch_hook` records one `Event` per Claude Code
  lifecycle hook (`SessionStart`, `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `UserPromptSubmit`,
  `Stop`, …), `OBSERVED_DURING` the active intent.
- **Lifecycle transition events** (Spec 344, draft) — every `lifecycle.move` will
  emit a typed `LifecycleEvent` (terminal/blocked → graph `Event`; churn →
  monitor).
- **Capability-internal effects** — e.g. `frugal.debt` harvesting markers, a gate
  passing — emit *nothing* a third party can react to.

**The reference need (the owner's concrete example):** the `frugal` capability
(Spec 348) wants to react to `PreToolUse` and, the **first** time a given tool is
used in a session, inject a relevant snippet — then stay silent. Spec 195 Slice 2
(SHIPPED) already injects MCP-equivalent suggestions on raw-tool use via
`_pre_tool_use_handler` → `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext`, but it (a) fires
*every* time, and (b) is hardcoded in the engine, not a capability subscription.
The bus generalizes it: **a capability declares the subscription; the bus dedups
once-per-session; the engine stays generic.**

Goal 3 (agent-uniform lifecycle, no special-casing) and Goal 2 (the provenance
moat) both want reactions to be *declared and recorded*, not hand-wired in the
engine per case.

## Design

### 1. A unified event taxonomy

One namespace covers every source, so a subscriber registers for any of them with
the same shape: **`<source>:<name>[:<qualifier>]`**.

| Source | Examples | Backed by |
|---|---|---|
| `hook:` | `hook:PreToolUse`, `hook:SessionStart`, `hook:Stop` | Spec 076 dispatch |
| `lifecycle:` | `lifecycle:transition:completed`, `lifecycle:transition:blocked` | Spec 344 `LifecycleEvent` |
| `capability:` | `capability:frugal:debt_harvested`, `capability:gate:passed` | `event.emit` (§5) |
| `*` | every event (the existing catch-all) | Spec 076 |

The taxonomy is a *string convention*, not a new enum to maintain (CLAUDE.md #8 —
open set). `dispatch_hook` already matches `event_name` then `*`; the bus extends
the same matcher to the `<source>:` prefixes.

### 2. Declarative subscriptions (the missing loop)

A pillar declares interest the same way it declares verbs/skills — as data on its
registration, not an imperative `register_hook_handler` call:

```python
# on a capability's ontology / registration
subscriptions = [
    Subscription(
        event="hook:PreToolUse",
        handler="on_first_tool_use",   # a method on the capability
        once_per="session.tool",       # dedup key (§6); "" = every time
        filter={"tool_name": "*"},     # optional predicate
        priority=50,                   # lower runs first (§7)
    ),
]
```

At engine bootstrap, **one loop** walks every discovered capability (and the
intent/memory pillars, §3), reads `subscriptions`, and calls the existing
`register_hook_handler(event, bound_handler)` — closing the gap the infra audit
found. The primitive is unchanged; the bus is the *reader* that was missing.

> **Why declarative, not imperative:** a declared subscription is inspectable
> (`search`/`manage` can list "who listens to `hook:Stop`"), driftable
> (`# AGENCY-DRIFT: event-subscribers`), and recorded — an imperative
> `register_hook_handler` in `__init__` is none of these. Same reasoning as
> verbs-by-reflection.

### 3. The three pillars are symmetric subscribers

Not only capabilities — **Capability · Intent/Lifecycle · Memory** all register
interest, treated uniformly (the "each pillar can emit" directive):

- **Capability** — `frugal` subscribes to `hook:PreToolUse` (the reference, §4);
  `gate` could subscribe to `lifecycle:transition:blocked`.
- **Intent / Lifecycle** — subscribes to `lifecycle:transition:blocked` to record
  a blocker on the serving intent; to `hook:UserPromptSubmit` for the Spec 321
  new-intent watch (already hook-driven — folds onto the bus).
- **Memory** — subscribes to `hook:Stop` / `hook:SessionEnd` to persist a
  reflection; to `capability:*:*` to accrue cross-session observations.

Each subscriber is a small handler returning either `additionalContext` (text to
inject back to the agent) or a side effect (a graph write). Symmetry means a new
pillar reaction is a *subscription*, never an engine edit.

### 4. The reference subscriber — first-use-once emit

The owner's concrete example, fully specified (this is the bus's canonical proof):

```
event:     hook:PreToolUse
subscriber: frugal (Spec 348)
handler:   on_first_tool_use(event) ->
             tool = event["tool_name"]
             if already_emitted(session_id, tool):  return {}      # silent
             snippet = frugal.instructions(compact=True, for_tool=tool)
             mark_emitted(session_id, tool)                          # once
             return {"additionalContext": snippet}
once_per:  "session.tool"     # dedup key = (session_id, tool_name)
```

- **Generalizes Spec 195 S2:** S2 emits MCP suggestions *every* PreToolUse; the
  bus adds the *once-per-(session,tool)* dedup and moves the trigger from a
  hardcoded engine handler to a `frugal` subscription. S2's
  `additionalContext` channel is reused verbatim.
- **The "once" state is in the graph,** not a process global: each emit records an
  `Event{name:"first_use_emit", session, tool, subscriber}` (Spec 076 node,
  full-capture). `already_emitted` is a graph read of that event for
  `(session, tool)` — so dedup survives within the session and is *queryable*
  (replayable via `dogfood.replay_events`, Spec 195).
- **Many more emits follow the same template:** `gate` on first failure, `develop`
  on first edit of an unfamiliar file, `research` on first web fetch — each a
  subscription, each once-keyed, each recorded.

### 5. The emission API — `event.emit`

A capability emits a custom event (the third source) with one verb:

```
event.emit(name="capability:frugal:debt_harvested", payload={...})
  -> records Event{name, payload} OBSERVED_DURING the active intent
  -> fans out to every subscriber of that event (and of "*")
```

Spec 344's `LifecycleEvent` becomes the *lifecycle-shaped special case* of
`event.emit` (it already records an `Event`; the bus just adds the fan-out step).
No new node type — every emission is a Spec 076 `Event` (reuse, per Spec 344's own
"reuse, not a new event system"). The `event` substrate (a tiny capability or a
`ctx.events` substrate surface — slice spec decides) owns `emit` + the registry
read verbs (`event.subscribers(event)`, `event.log(intent)`).

### 6. config.yaml — external hooks + subscription overrides (deferred impl)

A `config.yaml` `events:` section lets a user wire reactions **without code** —
external hooks (shell/webhook) and subscription toggles:

```yaml
events:
  subscriptions:
    - event: "lifecycle:transition:completed"
      run: "./scripts/notify.sh"        # external hook — LATER to implement
    - event: "hook:PreToolUse"
      emit: "frugal:first_use_snippet"
      once_per: "session.tool"
    - event: "capability:gate:blocked"
      disable: true                      # opt out of a built-in subscription
```

**Constraint the infra audit surfaced (`agency-infra.md` §4):** `_config.py` is an
open registry but **no list-valued config round-trips through the scaffold today**
— only scalars. The `events.subscriptions` list needs a **list-aware
`_yaml_scalar` branch** (a documented `_config` extension this spec calls for).
The *external-hook runner* (executing `run:` targets) is explicitly **later to
implement** — this spec defines the config shape and the safety contract
(external hooks run sandboxed, time-bounded, failure-isolated like the Node
graceful-degrade contract), not the runner.

### 7. Ordering, dedup, and failure-isolation (the safety contract)

- **Ordering.** Multiple subscribers on one event run in ascending `priority`,
  then registration order — deterministic.
- **Dedup.** `once_per` keys (`"session"`, `"session.tool"`, `"intent"`, `""`) are
  resolved against recorded emit-Events (§4), not memory — survives compaction
  within a session.
- **Failure-isolation.** A subscriber that raises is logged and skipped; it
  **never** breaks the triggering hook/transition (the `frugal_prefix` "never
  raises" precedent, `_frugal.py:120-128`). One bad subscriber can't take down
  `PreToolUse`.
- **No new async.** Claude Code hooks are synchronous; the bus dispatch stays
  synchronous within the hook call. External hooks (§6) are the only path that may
  fan out to a subprocess, and they are time-bounded.
- **Provenance.** Every delivery records the Event `OBSERVED_DURING` the intent
  with a `DELIVERED_TO`/`EMITTED_BY` edge to the subscriber/emitter — so "what
  reacted to what" is a graph query, replayable.

### 8. Flow

```
trigger:  hook stdin  |  lifecycle.move  |  capability event.emit
   |             |              |
   +------> normalize to <source>:<name>[:<qualifier>] ------+
                                                             v
                          resolve subscribers (declared §2/§3 + config §6)
                                                             v
                     for each, ascending priority:
                        filter? + once_per dedup (graph §6) ──skip──> next
                        run handler  ── raises ──> log + skip (§7)
                        record Event OBSERVED_DURING intent + DELIVERED_TO edge
                        collect additionalContext
                                                             v
                     external subscriptions (config §6) → sandboxed run (LATER)
                                                             v
                     aggregate additionalContext → return to host
```

### What this spec does NOT do (no build)

- No implementation — design record only (owner Q4). A later slice spec
  (`349a …`) implements the bootstrap loop + `event.emit` + the first-use-once
  subscriber.
- No new `Event` node type — reuses Spec 076 (per Spec 344).
- No external-hook *runner* — §6 defines the config shape + safety contract; the
  runner is "later to implement".
- No async/daemon — synchronous within the hook (§7).
- No change to Spec 332 frugal content or Spec 348's verb surface — `frugal` is a
  *consumer* of this bus, designed in 348, subscribing per §4.

## Acceptance (Gherkin — the contract a later slice implements)

```gherkin
Scenario: a declared subscription reacts when its event fires (behaviour, not the call)
  Given a capability declaring subscriptions=[{event:"hook:PreToolUse", handler:"on_first_tool_use"}]
  And the engine has booted
  When hook:PreToolUse fires
  Then the on_first_tool_use handler runs and its effect is observable
  And search/manage lists the capability as a subscriber of that event

Scenario: first use of a tool emits once, then stays silent (observable, not internal state)
  Given the frugal first-use subscription is active in a session
  When PreToolUse fires for tool "Bash" the first time
  Then the injected context contains the frugal snippet
  When PreToolUse fires for tool "Bash" again in the same session
  Then the injected context omits the frugal snippet (once_per session.tool)

Scenario: one capability emits, another reacts
  Given memory subscribes to "capability:frugal:debt_harvested"
  When frugal.debt calls event.emit("capability:frugal:debt_harvested", payload)
  Then memory's handler runs and the delivery is recorded DELIVERED_TO memory

Scenario: intent and memory are symmetric subscribers
  Given intent subscribes to "lifecycle:transition:blocked"
  When a lifecycle moves to "input-required"
  Then the intent handler records a blocker on the serving intent

Scenario: a failing subscriber never breaks the trigger
  Given a subscriber whose handler raises
  When its event fires
  Then the triggering hook still returns normally
  And the failure is logged, the other subscribers still run

Scenario: config.yaml registers an external hook (shape only; runner deferred)
  Given events.subscriptions in .agency/config.yaml with a run: target
  When config loads
  Then the list-valued subscription round-trips through _config
  And the external-hook target is recorded as a pending subscription (not yet executed)

Scenario: every delivery is replayable provenance
  Given several emits during an intent
  When I call dogfood.replay_events(intent_id)
  Then each delivery appears as an Event in recorded order
```

## Refinement — spec-panel pass (2026-06-20)

`spec-panel-review.md` (critique, 6.8→8.1). These folds are **authoritative**:

- **B1 — the bus is SUBSTRATE, not a capability (the Spec 338 precedent).**
  Resolved: `ctx.events` + `event_*` substrate tools (`event_emit`,
  `event_subscribers`, `event_log`), seeded in `Engine.__init__` like `hook_event`
  and the lifecycle pillar — NOT `agency/capabilities/events/`. Capabilities
  *consume* the substrate; they don't host it. (Supersedes §5's "slice spec
  decides" hedge.)
- **B2 — re-entrancy contract.** An `event.emit` raised inside a delivery is
  **enqueued and drained breadth-first after** the current fan-out, never
  recursed. A hard depth/fan cap (config; default 3 / 64) bounds storms; emits
  beyond it are dropped-with-warning (warn-don't-cut applies to the log, not the
  dispatch). Dispatch stays synchronous; re-entry does not recurse.
- **M1 — `additionalContext` aggregation.** Ordered by subscriber `priority` then
  name, deduped by content hash, **token-bounded** (reuse `shell.filter` —
  "hook-ready"), each fragment labelled with its emitter.
- **M2 — hot-path dedup.** `once_per` is an **in-session memo written through to
  the graph**: the memo (keyed `session.tool`) is the O(1) read path; the
  `first_use_emit` Event is written once for durability/replay. The graph is truth
  on a cold session; the memo is the hot path — no graph query per `PreToolUse`.
- **M3 — acceptance altitude.** Every scenario asserts observable behaviour, never
  an internal call ("register_hook_handler was called") — CLAUDE.md rule 7. (First
  scenario already re-altituded above.)
- **M4 — payload evolution.** Event payloads are **emitter-typed and append-only**
  (fields added, never renamed/removed within a name); subscribers MUST tolerate
  unknown fields (forward-compat).
- **m1 — `config disable:`** is keyed by `(event, handler)`; a `disable` matching
  no declared subscription is a config warning, not a silent no-op.
- **m2 — external-hook trust boundary.** A `run:` shell hook executes with the
  user's privileges; the repo owner editing the project's own `config.yaml` IS the
  trust boundary (the ponytail "trust node on PATH" shape). External hooks run only
  from the project's `config.yaml`, sandboxed + time-bounded (deferred runner).

Acceptance additions: a re-entrant emit drains without recursion (B2); two
subscribers' context merges token-bounded + labelled (M1); an extra payload field
doesn't break a subscriber (M4).

### 2nd-pass folds (post-fold verification, 2026-06-20)

`spec-panel-review.md` §"2nd pass" (8.1→8.5, no open blockers). B1+B2 verified;
two new folds, both from the agency hook PROCESS model:

- **M5 — the `once_per` memo is the Spec 336 ephemeral `.agency/toolcalls.db`, not
  a process global.** Spec 076 runs each hook via the `agency hook` CLI — a FRESH
  PROCESS per event — so an in-process memo dies between `PreToolUse` calls and
  dedup never fires. The session-scoped toolcalls.db (already in the hook path) is
  the O(1) read/write-through; the durable `first_use_emit` Event keeps replay.
  (Reuses shipped infra — the ladder: installed dependency over new code.)
- **M6 — the enqueue-drain completes within the one synchronous hook call.** The
  host consumes `additionalContext` from the return, so re-entrant emits drain
  after the current fan-out but BEFORE the hook returns — non-recursive, nothing
  crosses the return boundary.

## Refinement — 3rd pass (Jules critical review, PR #222 / REVIEW-348-349.md)

A delegated Jules review severity-ranked both specs → REFINE. Four 349 findings,
all folded (authoritative):

- **S1 (blocker) — high-volume events never graph-record a delivery.** §7's "every
  delivery records an Event" would re-create the Spec 336 bloat on `hook:PreToolUse`
  (fires on every tool call), regardless of a subscriber's `once_per`. **FIX:** the
  bus **forbids graph-recording deliveries for high-volume events at the engine
  level** — `hook:PreToolUse`/`PostToolUse` (and any event flagged `high_volume`)
  record their deliveries to the Spec 336 `toolcalls.db` / the monitor channel
  ONLY, never a graph `Event` per delivery, **even if a subscriber asks for it**.
  This is the Spec 344 B4 split applied to the bus (low-volume → durable graph
  Event; high-volume → ephemeral store). Replay (§4) reads the ephemeral store for
  those. Supersedes §7's "every delivery records the Event".
- **S1 (blocker) — `toolcalls.db` concurrency on the hot path.** `PreToolUse` can
  fire concurrently → multiple `agency hook` processes → SQLite `database is
  locked`. **FIX (the M5 once_per memo):** open `toolcalls.db` in **WAL mode** with
  a short `busy_timeout` (~250ms) and a strict **fail-open** degrade — if the lock
  times out, the dedup check is SKIPPED and the tool call proceeds unblocked (a
  duplicate snippet is acceptable; a blocked tool call is not). The hot path never
  raises and never waits.
- **S2 (major) — synchronous-drain wall-clock budget.** M6's drain runs before the
  hook returns; a slow external `run:` hook or verb could exceed the host's hook
  timeout and crash the session. **FIX:** the drain has a **strict enforceable
  wall-clock budget** (config, default ~500ms); on exceed it **truncates, logs a
  timeout warning, and returns immediately** with whatever `additionalContext`
  accrued. Session liveness always wins over completeness.
- **S3 (minor) — acceptance at behaviour altitude.** The first-use Gherkin still
  asserted internal state ("an Event{name:'first_use_emit'} is recorded").
  **FIX:** rewritten to observable outcomes — "the injected context contains / omits
  the frugal snippet" (the Acceptance block above is updated). `event.subscribers`
  / `dogfood.replay_events` remain legitimate observable *verb* surfaces, not
  internal-state probes.

Acceptance additions: a high-volume delivery records NO graph Event (S1); a
locked `toolcalls.db` fails open and the tool still runs (S1); the drain returns
within budget under a slow subscriber (S2).

## Followup — Implementation Status (2026-06-20)

Not started — **design record, no build** (owner Q4). Opened by the owner's
"events configurable + pillars register for events + first-use-once emit"
directive. Designs the bus on top of the *open* `register_hook_handler` primitive
(Spec 076, shipped) that no loop currently reads: a `<source>:<name>` taxonomy,
declarative `subscriptions` on capability/intent/memory read by one bootstrap
loop, an `event.emit` fan-out reusing the Spec 076 `Event` node, a `config.yaml`
`events:` registry (needs the list-valued `_config` branch; external-hook runner
deferred), and the first-use-once reference subscriber that generalizes the
shipped Spec 195 Slice 2. Safety contract: deterministic priority, graph-keyed
`once_per` dedup, failure-isolation (the `frugal_prefix` precedent), synchronous
dispatch. `frugal` (Spec 348) is the reference emitter/subscriber. **Improves**
Spec 344 (its `LifecycleEvent` becomes the lifecycle-shaped `event.emit`) and Spec
347 (the frugal stamp/first-use emit are delivered via this bus) — cross-refs
added to both.

**349a Slice 1 SHIPPED 2026-06-20** — the first-use-once emit. Substrate
`agency/_events.py` (B1: a module registry the engine consumes, NOT a capability):
`subscribe(event, handler, once_per, name)` + `run(engine, event, ev)` fanning a
hook out to its subscriptions. The `once_per="session.tool"` dedup is a
per-subscriber marker in the **Spec 336 ephemeral store** (M5 — survives the
fresh-process-per-hook model), **fail-open** (a store error never blocks the tool
call) and **fail-isolated** (a raising subscriber is skipped), and records **no
graph Event per delivery** (S1 — the marker is ephemeral, so a high-volume
`PreToolUse` can't recreate the Spec 336 bloat). `frugal` is the reference
subscriber: `on_first_tool_use` returns a frugal hint on the FIRST `PreToolUse` of
a tool in a session (silent at level `off`), merged into the PreToolUse
`additionalContext` by `engine._pre_tool_use_handler`. Behaviour-tested (first →
hint; second identical call → silent).

**349b §2 SHIPPED 2026-06-20 — declarative subscriptions + the bootstrap loop
(THE missing reader).** `_events.Subscription(event, handler, once_per, priority,
name)` is DATA a capability declares (`subscriptions = (...)`); `as_capability`
carries it + the source `module` onto the compiled `Capability`; the engine
bootstrap (`__init__` + `reload`) runs ONE loop
(`_events.register_capability_subscriptions`) that resolves each `handler` NAME
against the cap's module and `subscribe`s it. `subscribe`/`run` gained `priority`
(ascending, then registration order — the §7 deterministic-ordering contract).
`frugal` migrated off its import-time `_events.subscribe` to the declarative form
(the reference subscriber). Substrate subscribers (`lifecycle.monitor`, Spec
344/349b) keep their import-time `subscribe` — they are not capabilities.
`# AGENCY-DRIFT: event-subscribers` tags the loop. 2 new acceptance scenarios
(bootstrap registration + priority ordering); the existing frugal first-use test
stays green through the declarative path.

**Still (349c+):** the lifecycle/`intent`/`memory` pillars as symmetric declarative
subscribers (§3); `event.emit` for custom + lifecycle events (§5); the
`config.yaml` `events:` registry + external-hook runner (§6); M1 token-bounded
aggregation; the optional `filter` predicate on `Subscription`.
